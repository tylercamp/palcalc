## Current Focus
**Complete Game Rebalance Mod Support Analysis** completed — comprehensive architecture plan for integrating CGR mod support into PalCalc's breeding optimization system.

## Recent Changes
| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2025-08-02 | **MAJOR:** Completed Complete Game Rebalance mod support analysis. Identified critical missing breeding mechanics (inheritance rates, boss pal rates, egg mechanics) and designed comprehensive integration architecture. |
| 2025-08-02 | Analyzed and documented PAK file extraction properties in `architecture.md` section 3a. |
| 2025-07-02 | Added `product.md`, `architecture.md`, `tech.md` to memory-bank. |

## Key Findings from CGR Analysis
- **Missing Critical Properties**: `Combi_TalentInheritNum`, `Combi_BossPalRate`, `PalEggRankInfoArray` from `BP_PalGameSetting_C`
- **Significant Impact**: CGR guarantees perfect IV inheritance (`[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]` vs vanilla `[3.0, 2.0, 1.0]`) and 3x higher boss pal breeding rate
- **Architecture Designed**: GameSettings model, ModDetectionService, dynamic breeding calculations
- **Implementation Strategy**: 3-phase approach (infrastructure → mod support → solver integration)

## Next Steps
1. Implement CGR mod support using the designed architecture
2. Add GameSettings extraction from BP_PalGameSetting_C
3. Create mod detection and configuration system
4. Update breeding solver to use dynamic parameters
